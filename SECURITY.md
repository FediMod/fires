## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've identified a security vulnerability in FediMod FIRES (a bug that allows something to happen that shouldn't be possible), you can:

- open a [GitHub security issue on the FediMod FIRES project](https://github.com/fedimod/fires/security/advisories/new)

You should _not_ report such issues in public GitHub issues or in other public spaces to give us time to publish a fix for the issue without exposing FIRES operators to increased risk.

### Scope

A "vulnerability in FediMod FIRES" is a vulnerability in the code distributed through our main source code repository on GitHub. Vulnerabilities that are specific to a given installation (e.g. misconfiguration) should be reported to the owner of that installation and not us.
