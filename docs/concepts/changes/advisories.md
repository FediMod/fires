# Advisories

Advisories allow data providers to put out an early warning about an entity, without yet recommending a specific action be taken, and they typically come before the creation recommendations.

A FediMod FIRES dataset can contain information about both recommendations of domains to defederate from and advisories against domains that are friendly federators (i.e., who is federating with the domains that the same dataset recommends defederation from).
