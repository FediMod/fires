# Data Consumer

> [!CAUTION]
> This section of the documentation is still being written.

A **Data Consumer** is any application or software that consumes data from a FIRES server.

For example, a data consumer may automate the API interactions with Fediverse software for creating, updating, and removing domain blocks using the changes in the FIRES dataset for Domains.
