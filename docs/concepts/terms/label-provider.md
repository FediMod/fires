# Label Provider

> [!CAUTION]
> This section of the documentation is still being written.

A **Label Provider** maintains a collection of [labels](../labels) and publishes these as both a website and linked data dataset via content negotiation.

**Label Providers** are not necessarily [Data Providers](./data-provider), the two are separate as to encourage different Data Providers to reuse pre-existing labels for their moderation data.
