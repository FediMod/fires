# Label Provider

A **Label Provider** maintains a collection of [labels](../labels) and publishes these as both a website and linked data dataset via content negotiation. Label Providers are not necessarily [Data Providers](./data-provider), the two are separate as to encourage different Data Providers to reuse pre-existing labels for their moderation data.
