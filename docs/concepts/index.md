# Concepts

In order to better understand FIRES, there are several guiding concepts that are worth understanding. We've also published the [project background](./background/index.md) to help explain the context in which FediMod FIRES has been created.

- [Federation Management](./federation-management) – using policies to control what we accept, filter, reject, and ignore when federating.
- [Managing Changes](./changes.md) – managing moderation decisions changing over time.
  - [Advisories](./changes/advisories.md)
  - [Recommendations](./changes/recommendations.md)
  - [Retractions](./changes/retractions.md)
  - [Tombstones](./changes/tombstones.md)
- [Entities](./entities) – the support types of entities.
- [Filters](./filters) – using filters as part of federation management.
- [Labels](./labels) – organising moderation decisions using shared vocabularies of labels.

Additionally, there are some definitions for what a [data consumer](./terms/data-consumer.md), [data provider](./terms/data-provider.md), and [label provider](./terms/label-provider.md) are, that can be helpful to read first.
