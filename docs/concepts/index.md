# Concepts

In order to better understand FIRES, there are several guiding concepts that are worth understanding.

- [Firewall-based Federation Management](./federation-firewalls) – Using policies to control what we accept, filter, and reject when federating.
- [Labelling](./labels) – Organising data using shared vocabularies.
- [Advisories & Recommendations](./advisories-and-recommendations) – The different types of moderation decisions that FIRES supports.
- [Retractions](./retractions) – Sometimes moderation decisions change and we need to issue a retraction to a previously made decision.
