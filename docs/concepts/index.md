# Concepts

In order to better understand FIRES, there are several guiding concepts that are worth understanding.

- [Firewall-based Federation Management](./federation-firewalls) – Using policies to control what we accept, filter, reject, and ignore when federating.
- [Managing Changes](./changes.md) – How FIRES manages data changing over time.
  - [Advisories](./changes/advisories.md)
  - [Recommendations](./changes/recommendations.md)
  - [Retractions](./changes/retractions.md)
  - [Tombstones](./changes/tombstones.md)
- [Filters](./filters) – Shared vocabularies of filters to apply when applying a moderation decision.
- [Labels](./labels) – Organising moderation decisions using shared vocabularies of labels.
