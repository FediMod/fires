# Concepts

In order to better understand FIRES, there are several guiding concepts that are worth understanding.

- [Firewall-based Federation Management](./federation-firewalls) – Using policies to control what we accept, filter, reject, and ignore when federating.
- [Advisories & Recommendations](./advisories-and-recommendations) – The different types of moderation decisions supported.
- [Filters](./filters) – Shared vocabularies of filters to apply when applying a moderation decision.
- [Labels](./labels) – Organising moderation decisions using shared vocabularies of labels.
- [Retractions](./retractions) – Sometimes moderation decisions change and we need to issue a retraction to a previously made decision.
